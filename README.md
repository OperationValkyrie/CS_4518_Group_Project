Team 1009
Inside our zip file, we have our cleaned code, our debug, a video showing the app running by itself, a video
showing the app running with the analysis active, and an analysis doc that goes over the statistics gathered
by the analysis. We split the project into several parts. We first started by creating the UI to take photos
with the camera and take existing photos from the gallery. The next part of the project involved using the 
model from project 4 to guess what each of the images contained. Finally, we compare the images to each other to
see if they could be the same objects. After all of the code was written, we worked on analyzing the usage
statistics using the profiler on Android Studio.
